        content: "Here's a secret: I've written workout programs that were featured in men's magazines and workout books, only to see those exact same programs later printed in the same publisher's women's magazines and books. The only thing that was changed was the terminology. In the men's version it said something like, \"use this workout program to build a stronger and more ripped body,\" whereas in the women's version it said something like, \"use this workout program to shape the tight and toned body of a goddess.\"Despite how it might seem, I don't think this common practice is dishonest or misleading. After all, even the best workout won't do anyone any good if it's not put into practice. Publishers are merely trying to reach out to their readers using goals they hear them expressing. Put another way, if exercise is medicine, then we're much more likely to take our daily dose when it tastes good to us. Plus, it's not like gyms are actually packed with men and women doing the same solid workout, only calling it by different names. Instead, all this focus on labels like \"toned\" vs. \"strong\" has led people to believe that they belong only in one part of a gym, or that another part is somehow off limits to them. Men stampede toward the free weights, while women pack into the Pilates and yoga studios and line up on cardio machines. The truth, as you might expect, is that we'd probably be best served by meeting somewhere in the middle. Both sides could benefit from some of what the other is doing, but there are a few things that both sides should keep in mind to help get the most out of their time in the gym."

        content: "When circumstances are beyond our control, we sometimes have to get creative with our training. Perhaps it's finding ways to get in sessions at home when the gym just isn't an option, or maybe we seek training alternatives to come back after an injury or time off. If you face any of these situations, or if you just want a different way to get the job done, resistance bands are the tool you need to add to your tool bag, or rather, gym bag. Bands provide numerous benefits that will make even the most hardcore iron disciples decide they are worth the investment."

        content: "When I became a full-time personal trainer in 2006, I felt ready for the gym floor. I'd graduated from college with a degree in kinesiology and three years of experience training my fellow students in the university's fitness center. Even more magically, I immediately got a job at a high-end gym in Torontoâ€”one that paid $25 an hour, a startling income for a 21-year-old still living at home.Most trainers aren't nearly that lucky. As we discovered in our first-ever personal trainer salary survey, it often takes several years of experience before they have a full client roster and a livable income. If you're someone who's starting a career in the fitness industry, or contemplating it, let's talk about what it costs to become a personal trainer, how much you can expect to make, and how to stay in the business long enough to build a career. If you're someone who works with a trainer, or is contemplating it, you'll see what fitness pros typically earn, how they earn it, and how to get the most for your money."
